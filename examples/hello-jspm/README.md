# Angular Next - Hello jspm

This is a hello world app that uses Angular Next and [jspm](http://jspm.io/).

### Demo

[http://robianmcd.github.io/angular-next/examples/hello-jspm/](http://robianmcd.github.io/angular-next/examples/hello-jspm/)

### Run locally

```sh
git clone https://github.com/robianmcd/angular-next.git
cd angular-next/examples/hello-jspm
npm insatll -g jspm
jspm install
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

You can now access the app at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/). Note: the `python` command depends on Python 2.7 and just serves your files. In Python 3 the command would be `python -m http.server`.


### Files

* *jspm_packages/* - Generated by running `jspm install`. This is basically node_modules for jspm.
* *app.js* - Sets up the angular app and defines the `helloComponent` directive.
* *config.js* - Configuration file for jspm. Note the custom `traceurOptions` that are required to work with Angular Next. This file also aliases the Angular Next module as angular2.
* *index.html* - Runs the app's main function which bootstraps the angular app.
* *package.json* - Specifies the dependency on Angular Next.
